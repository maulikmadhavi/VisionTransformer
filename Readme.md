# Introduction

This repository demonstrates the use of Vision Transformer from scratch. The neural network code is written in PyTorch. It is adapted and inspired from the youtube [reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovB0ddFtzzA).

# Implementation

The main file used in this project is `vit_scratch.py`, which contains the implementation of the Vision Transformer model. This file is responsible for defining the architecture of the model, including the transformer blocks, positional encoding, and classification head.

The `vit_verification.py` file is used to verify the implementation of the model. It is used to verify the output of the model, and to check if the model is working as expected. The model is compared against the official timm implementation of the Vision Transformer model.
